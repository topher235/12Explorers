# 12Explorers
Repository for the CNU 12Explorers app comp.

I developed this app for a competition at CNU. Unfortunately, due to some poor communication
I was unable to submit it and find out how it would have done.

This is a trivia game app using information from https://12explorers.com as insipiration for
the questions. Users can answer questions everyday in one of two game modes: Two Choice and
Four Choice. Like the names imply, there are two answer choices and four answer choices,
respectively, for the questions in the mode. Users can compete for the top spots on the
Leaderboard by answering questions correctly for points.

As this was my second app, I ventured further and tried to do bigger and more complex
things. As opposed to my first app, users now have slight interaction through the Leaderboard.
I looked into different assets that could be used (pictures, sounds, etc.), and settled on
some nice royalty-free options. Firebase is still my choice for the database because I was
familiar with the platform and it works.

Areas of improvement:
  1. UI Design - I will always admit that my design work needs improvement. Comparing all
  of the parts of this app, the look and feel is my least favorite part. I attempted a
  game-y look without wanting to pay for it and it shows. I am practicing my design with
  every new project I do.
  
  2. Testing - I would have liked to do automated testing with Espresso, but I did
  not because I thought I had a short development time frame. In the future, I plan to
  use Espresso to take a more test-driven development (TDD) approach.
